This demonstrates a simple application that exposes a RESTful API using Spring Boot and Maven.
To run it ensure that you have https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi[Maven installed].

You can the run this project using

   $ mvn spring-boot:run

The application will be available at http://localhost:8080/

You can also create an executable jar using

   $ mvn package

By making the executable jar Maven is no longer necessary.
Instead we can execute it using java command.

   $ java -jar target/*.jar

For additional information on using Spring Boot and Maven refer to http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/getting-started-installing-spring-boot.html#getting-started-maven-installation[Spring Boot Reference]
