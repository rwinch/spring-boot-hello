This demonstrates a simple application that exposes a RESTful API using Spring Boot and Gradle.

You can the run this project using

   $ ./gradlew bootRun

The application will be available at http://localhost:8080/

You can also create an executable jar using

   $ ./gradlew build

By making the executable jar Maven is no longer necessary.
Instead we can execute it using java command.

   $ java -jar build/libs/*.jar

For additional information on using Spring Boot and Gradle refer to http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/getting-started-installing-spring-boot.html#getting-started-gradle-installation[Spring Boot Reference]
