This demonstrates a "Hello Boot" application that fits in a single tweet.
To run it http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/getting-started-installing-spring-boot.html#getting-started-installing-the-cli[Install the Spring Boot CLI] and execute:

   $ spring run app.groovy

The application will be available at http://localhost:8080/

You can also create an executable jar using

   $ spring jar app.jar app.groovy

By making the executable jar the Spring Boot CLI is no longer necessary.

   $ java -jar app.jar

For real applications, consider using Maven or Gradle based builds.
